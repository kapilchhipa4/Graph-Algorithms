1. DFS
2. BFS
3. shortest path  : dijkstra, bellman ford, fload warshall. (sometime BFS if weight is same)
4. minimum spanning tree: prims, kruskal
5. cycle detection:

    directed graph : DFS, 
    undirected graph
6. Strongly connected component: Targan's algorithm, kosaraju algorithm
7. topological sort
