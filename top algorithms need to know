1. DFS
2. BFS
3. connected component: undirected graph , each vertex is accessible from another vertex.
4. shortest path  : dijkstra, bellman ford(negative weight cycle), fload warshall. (sometime BFS if weight is same)
5. minimum spanning tree: prims, kruskal
6. cycle detection:

    directed graph : DFS,BFS both will work
    undirected graph
7. Strongly connected component: 
    Targan's algorithm
    kosaraju algorithm (two time DFS)
    directed graph
8. topological sort
9. bipartite graph
10. DSU
11. Articulation point/cut vertex
